                    <p class="project-page-text">I had decided to create a clothing storefront that was in desktop form. From there, I created a user persona for the intended audience this service was for. Using that persona, I created a user scenario to empathize with that intended user.
                        This transitioned into a user flow (flowchart), which I then used to create the processes shown in this demo. These involved: signing-in to an account, navigating to assorted items in the storefront, adding items to a bookmark/favorites system, and a checkout system.</p>

                    <p class="project-page-text">The initial steps later lead to the creation of the this prototype. This involved research as to standard clothing e-commerce website practices and gathering images. The creation of the initial Figma prototype primarily revolved around creating a solid foundation or template that would be usable throughout the screens. This took a fair bit of trial-and-error tinkering with and refining these elements.
                    In addition to the base appearance and layout, many screens were created to allow for a smooth and clear process for the user. For example, I had created a search bar to quickly navigate to a given item in a set task, but also created screens for each category the user would have gotten had they not chosen to use the search bar. This phase ended with the creation of a rough high-fidelity interactive prototype.</p>

                    <p class="project-page-text">This phase started with user-testing. Using Maze, a test was created using the rough prototype which was then shared with 6 people. Over a week, more data was captured allowing refinement in the rough prototype. This data was valuable as it not only allowed people to give feedback regarding the prototype, but also highlighted information such as: how much time a screen took them, how many mis-clicks were there and more.</p>

                    <p class="project-page-text">Using the data gathered from the tests, the initial prototype was refined. Alterations were made to size, placement of elements, and more to create a user-friendly prototype. This considered the received feedback and targeted screens that took longer than expected to make for an efficient user flow. Additional feedback was also provided by the instructor through e-mail and Figma comments to polish any extra elements, and to introduce changes/additions to further improve the prototype.</p>
