This project was created for our UI/UX course at BCIT to practice designing for a chosen web-based platform, in this case desktop, and to gain skills in user experience processes for shopping, bookmarking, signing-in to an account, and optimizing the browsing experience.</p>

                    <p class="project-page-text">The initial process for creating this project primarily consisted of brainstorming, planning, and defining a plan of action. We had been taught to create user personas and scenarios to empathize with an intended demographic and help us plan steps and processes that would be in-line with that demographics needs and wants. In this instance, I had decided that a simple streamlined process, easy sign-up/sign-in process, and bookmarking features would be a good fit for this project.</p>

                    <p class="project-page-text">The design and prototype was created in Adobe XD, and keeps in mind the intended goals set out previously in the user persona and scenario. Research was done to make sure needed features were included appropriately, for example primary utilities like bookmarking, the shopping cart, search, and sign-in were easily accessible at the top of the design. This also factored into the layout of categories, which was designed with the intent to be easily approachable to a person who had visited a similar sort of website before, to avoid whiplash in the options presented. Multiple screens were created to lay out the various required workflows. This includes: signing-in, navigating to specific items, bookmarking, and completing the purchase of an item.</p>

                    <p class="project-page-text">As a second phase of this project,we were assigned to groups and tasked to test processes to discover flaws or points of improvements. To accomplish this, the testing software "Useberry" was used to conduct organized tests, and gather data. The tests consisted of the processes layed out previously, with each process being tested individually. Questions were also asked at the end of the test to gather further feedback and data regarding possible improvements. Using data such as: user feedback, completion time, preferred user flows, and click-testing, the prototype was refined for improved efficiency and usability.</p>
