                    <p class="project-page-text">A Web Design and UI/UX project for a mobile app centered around a pet-food delivery subscription service. This was a self-guided project, which was created to practice common user-flows in a mobile setting as opposed to a desktop setting. In this prototype: account creation, subscription-option selection, and payment flow features are included.</p>

                    <p class="project-page-text">As most of my experience with website prototypes has been with desktop viewports, I wanted to experiment with mobile variants. As most of the internet is accessed through mobile devices, optimized-for-mobile designs are very valuable. In order to do this, I wanted a simple and practical concept to apply my design ideas to. This resulted in the pet-food subscription service concept, as it includes subscription-option selection, and allows for a simple streamlined userflow, through onboarding and then by purchasing a product.</p>

                    <p class="project-page-text">The design and prototypes were created in Adobe XD, with some graphic elements being made in Adobe Illustrator. The big goal here was to make the userflow process simple to understand and seamless to progress through. To achieve this, contrast is utilized extensively to make elements stand out and easily readable. This is combined with an otherwise analogous color-scheme that invites a sense of warmth and comfort. As the focus was on pet-food, the graphics were chosen due to their cute and clean appearance, in order to appeal to the type of person interested in a service such as this.</p>

Emphasis is placed on the product itself, as well as a preferred action for the user with the appearance of a "best value" tag signifying the importance of a particular option. The following product purchase flow then is designed to maintain the established visual identity.</p>

                    <p class="project-page-text">The product purchase user-flow incorporates a 3-step based graphic that shows the user which step they are on currently. This helps to present information clearly to the user, and to inform them of how many more steps are ahead, giving them an idea of how long the process will take. Buttons to proceed to future steps are greyed-out until the appropriate information is filled out, to make clear the order of actions needed to be taken.
