Its aesthetics were created to convey its organic and ethically sourced qualities and incorporated into a consistent design system which inherently can be transferred to different forms. This was highlighted in the supporting materials presented (stationery/accessories).</p>

                    <p class="project-page-text">The design of the packaging and brand used a blend of a more rigid angular elements and flowing smooth elements. This is reflected both in iconography and in the typography with ITC Avant Garde having both round and angular elements. This represents the rectangular or square like structure of a chocolate while showing the smooth aspects of the taste itself. This combined with a minimalistic design style presents a clean image that communicates purpose of the brand and product.</p>

                        <p class="project-page-text">For the chosen stationery and accessories, I chose to do a business card as well as a tote bag. The designs for these were handled after the conclusion of the other elements and were in-line with the brand imagery by using the created style guide. This was done for brand exploration in various forms while still sticking to guidelines. The accessories themselves have a focus on negative space to get information across clearly and confidently.</p>

                            Initial brainstorming helped to break down the components of the brand, with elements such as the color/intended boldness/shapes explored. This also included the usage of ITC Avant Garde with it's mix of soft and rigid elements to embody a chocolate bar. These aspects were defined and put into a design system. This was to make sure the brand identity and aesthetic had guidelines to allow for general usage. This includes elements such as fonts, colors, and available logos.
