                    <p class="project-page-text">The design of the product packaging began soon after the branding elements were cemented. The brand imagery and style elements were simple but also popped effectively which allowed the product design to still retain the same consistent visual appearance while having enough appropriate space to present mandatory content such as nutritional information, product flavor and more.The type of packaging was also decided upon based on the general tone of the brand. Simple shape based boxes and cannisters with minimal colors to let the brand itself pop and effectively speak for itself in a confident and subdued manner</p>

                        <p class="project-page-text">The design direction of the advertisements geared towards a chill, comfortable tone, with colors 
                            representing the natural and plant-based aspects, while still having a unique aspect of modern 
                            minimal design with good amounts of negative space to let the various aspects breath and have a 
                            good consistency. 
                            Roughs were also created for this aspect and were also reviewed and polished for the result. 
                            Additionally, stock images that felt appropriate for the brand and design intention were found and 
                            used.
                            A challenge of this component was the balance of creating advertisements that were eye-catching 
                            and appealing, while still being consistent with the brand styles defined. Through feedback sessions, a 
                            good balance of imagery, brand assets, and negative space was decided upon for the result.
